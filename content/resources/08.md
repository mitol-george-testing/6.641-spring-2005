description: Excerpt from the course textbook on electromagnetic fields and energy.
  Topics include the vector potential and the vector Poisson equation, the Biot-Savart
  superpositional integral, the scalar magnetic potential, magnetoquasistatic fields
  in the presence of super conductors, piece-wise magnetic fields, vector potential,
  and the boundary value point of view.
